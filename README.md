# ATTENTION: I started building this project when I wasn't very familiar with GIT
## For this reason, most of the commits have been pushed to a branch named "new_branch"
## although it should be in the properly divided branches due to functionality

### This project was made for educational purposes so some features like
### filter and interceptor that only logs the request method and URI
### may seem nonsensial
